* How to Compile

If you use the GNU Guix package manager, you can run the command "guix shell -m manifest.scm" to create a seperate programming environment.
You can read more about this feature in the Guix Manual: [[https://guix.gnu.org/en/manual/devel/en/guix.html#Invoking-guix-shell][Guix Shell]] 
Otherwise you can install all the dependencies manually; These can be found in the manifest.scm file.
  
Run these bash scripts to compile the program:
#+BEGIN_SRC fundamental
./configure
./build
#+END_SRC

Then to run the program run the bash script *./run*
